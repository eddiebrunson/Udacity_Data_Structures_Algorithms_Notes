### Lesson 1: Binary Search

Binary search is probably one of the most common algorithms that we all use without even realizing we are using it.

To help build a little intuition for how it works, let's first look at a classic game where the most efficient way to win is to use binary search.

**Guess the number**

This notebook simulates a classic game where you have to guess a random number from within a certain range. Typically, you might have to guess a number from 1 to 10, and have three guesses to get the right answer.

In this case, you'll need to guess a random number between 1 and 100, and you will have 7 tries.

Try running it and playing a round or two. Notice that the game always tells you whether your guess was too high or too low. This information allows you to rule out some of the numbers (so that you don't waste time guessing those numbers).

With this fact in mind, try to make your guesses in the most efficient way you can. Specifically, try to make guesses that rule out the largest number of possibilities each time.

```Python
import random

def guess_the_number(total_tries, start_range, end_range):
    if start_range > end_range:
        start_range, end_range = end_range, start_range
        
    random_number = random.randint(start_range, end_range)
    try_count = 0
    success_message = "Awesome! You guessed correctly"
    failure_message = "Sorry! No more retries left"
    miss_message = "Oops! That's incorrect"
    
    num_tries = 0
    while num_tries < total_tries:
        attempt = int(input("Guess the number: "))
        
        if attempt == random_number:
            print(success_message)
            return
        print(miss_message)
        if attempt < random_number:
            print("Go higher!")
        else:
            print("Go lower!")
        num_tries += 1
    print(failure_message)

total_tries = 7
start_range = 1
end_range = 100
guess_the_number(total_tries, start_range, end_range)
```

Obviously, there is some randomness involved in this game, so in some cases you may run out of tries before guessing correctly. However, if you use a binary search strategy, you'll find the number efficiently and win most of the time.

But before we look further into binary search, let's first look at an alternative: Linear search.

**Linear search**
Suppose that you have a dictionary of words and that you need to look up a particular word in this dictionary. However, this dictionary is a pretty terrible dictionary, because the words are all in a scrambled order (and not alphabetical as they usually are). What search strategy would you use to find the definition you're looking for?

Because the words are in a random order, the best we can do is simply to go one by one, from the first page to the last page, in a sequential manner. Sounds tedious, right? This is called linear search. We have no idea about the order of the words, so we simply have to flip through the pages, one by one, until we find the word we are looking for.

With the example of the guessing game, you could use linear search there as well—by simply starting with 1 and guessing every number until you get to 100 (or rather, until you run out of tries and lose the game!).
