# 2. Data Structures

## Lesson 1: Arrays and Linked Lists

**Why data structures?**

1. Lists 

*Data Structures* are containers that organize and group data together in different ways. When you write code to solve a problem, there will always be data involved--and how you store or structure that data in the computer's memory can have a huge impact on what kinds of things you can do with it and how efficiently you can do those things. 

**Properties of collections**

* Don't have a particular order (so you can't say "give me the 3rd element in this collection")
* Don't have to have objects of the same type

There are many data structures that add rules to collections to be used in programming.
