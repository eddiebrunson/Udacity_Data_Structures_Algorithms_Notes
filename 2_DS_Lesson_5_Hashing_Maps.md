# 2. Data Structures 

## Lesson 5: Maps and Hashing 

___

### 1. Introduction to Maps 

The defining characteristic of a map is its *key value structure*.

You can look up where something is by its key value and then get whatever is stored at that value. 

We can look up something by its name and then go that that location to get the value. 

Maps are also called dictionaries. 

If you think of a word as a key and the definition as the value. 

___

### 2. Sets and Maps

A set is comparable to a list, its also vaguely a collection of things, but with one big difference.

A list has some kind of ordering for its elements. While a set doesn't have that, but instead doesn't allow for repeated elements. 

You can think of a set kind of like a bag. You can reach in and pull something out, but you will never know what order you're getting the elements out in. 

                              Map = < Key, Value >

A map is a set-based data structure, kind of like an array is a list-based data structure. 

A group of keys is a set. 

The keys in the map, like a dictionary, need to be unique. 

You can have several definitions for the same word stored in the value, but if you had the same word in the dictionary many times, you would randomly pick out a definition when you were first looking. 

Thus, each key exists once in a Map. 

A groupd ot this unique keys without any ordering is called a set.

### 3. Exploring the Map Concept 

In Python, the map concept appears as a built-in data type called a dictionary. A dictionary contains key-value pairs. Dictionaries might soon become your favorite data structure in Python‚Äîthey're extremely easy to use and useful. Here's a sample of setting up a dictionary. 

```Python
udacity = {}
udacity['u'] = 1
udacity['d'] = 2
udacity['a'] = 3
udacity['c'] = 4
udacity['i'] = 5
udacity['t'] = 6
udacity['y'] = 7

print (udacity)
# {'u': 1, 'd': 2, 'a': 3, 'c': 4, 'i': 5, 't': 6, 'y': 7}
```
In this case, the letters in "udacity" were each keys in our dictionary, and the position of that letter in the string was the value. Thus, I can do the following:

```Python
print (udacity['t'])
# 6
```

This statement is saying "go to the key labeled 't' and find it's value, 6".

Dictionaries are wonderfully flexible‚Äîyou can store a wide variety of structures as values. You store another dictionary or a list:

```Python
dictionary = {}
dictionary['d'] = [1]
dictionary['i'] = [2]
dictionary['c'] = [3]
dictionary['t'] = [4]
dictionary['i'].append(5)
dictionary['o'] = [6]
dictionary['n'] = [7]
dictionary['a'] = [8]
dictionary['r'] = [9]
dictionary['y'] = [10]
print (dictionary)
# {'d': [1], 'i': [2, 5], 'c': [3], 't': [4], 'o': [6], 'n': [7], 'a': [8], 'r': [9], 'y':[10]}
```

```Python
Time to play with Python dictionaries! You're going to work on a dictionary that stores cities by country and continent. One is done for you - the city of Mountain View is in the USA, which is in North America.

You need to add the cities listed below by modifying the structure. Then, you should print out the values specified by looking them up in the structure.

Cities to add: Bangalore (India, Asia) Atlanta (USA, North America) Cairo (Egypt, Africa) Shanghai (China, Asia)

locations = {'North America': {'USA': ['Mountain View']}}

Print the following (using "print").

A list of all cities in the USA in alphabetic order.
All cities in Asia, in alphabetic order, next to the name of the country. In your output, label each answer with a number so it looks like this:
1
American City
American City
2
Asian City - Country
Asian City - Country

```
```Python
# Code

locations = {'North America': {'USA': ['Mountain View']}}

# TODO: Print a list of all cities in the USA in alphabetic order.

# TODO: Print all cities in Asia, in alphabetic order, next to the name of the country

```

### 4. Introduction to Hashing

Using a data structure that employs a hash function allow you to do look ups in *constant time*.

With everything we learned so far, we do looks ups in *linear time* 

In a list or a set, you need to look through every element to find the one you're looking for. 

Stacks and Queues let you look up the oldest or newest elements immediately, and priority queues will let you find the highest priority elements quickly. 

The ability to do *constant time* look ups will make almost any algorithm you write instantly faster. 

___

### 5. Hashing

The purpose of a hash function is transform some value into one that can be stored and retrieved easily. 

You give it some value, it converts the value based on some formula, and spits out a coded version of the value that's often the index in an array.  

One common pattern in hash functions is to take the last few digits of a big number, divide it by some consistent number, and using the remainder from that division to find a place to store that number in a array. 

Example:

0123456 --> 56/10 = 5 with a remainder = 6 

6 | 0123456 

Give your number to a hash function, which spits out a hash code that turns into the index of an array. You can go to your array and get your orginial value in constant time. Since the array look up with an index happens in constant time. 


___

### 6. Collisions 

There are times when a hash function will spit out the same value for two different inputs. 

0123456 --> 56% of 10 = 6 

6543216 --> 16% of 10 = 6

This situation is called a **collision**.

There are two main ways to fix a collision. 

The first is to change the value in your hash function, or to change the hash function completely, so you have more than enough slots to store all of your potential values. 

Or instead of storing one hash value in each spot, you could store some type of list that contains all values hashed at that spot. These lists are generally called **buckets**. 

Buckets contain a collection of values.

You can maintain constant time look up, but by using a bigger number in your hash function, you're going to require a lot more space to store your values. Also if you do this reactively and change the value in your hash function every time you have a collision, moving all your data to a new array is going to definitely increase the complexity in terms of both size and time. 

With the bucket approach, you still need to iterate through some collection, though a shorter one, every time you're looking for something. 

Collisions in worst case complexity is **O(m)**.

You are expected to talk about the upsides and downsides to which every approach you use. 

___

### 7. Hash Maps

You can use the keys as inputs to a hash function, then store the key value pair in the bucket of the hash value producded by the function. 

Since you know that the keys in a map are unique since they belong to a set. You could use a hash function to give them each their own unique buckets. 

You could also design a hash function to allow for collisions. 

___

### 8. Hash Maps Notebook 

(In addition to having fun) We write programs to solve real world problems. Data structures help us in representing and efficiently manipulating the data associated with these problems.

Let us see if we can use any of the data structures that we already know to solve the following problem

**Problem Statement**
In a class of students, store heights for each student.


The problem in itself is very simple. We have the data of heights of each student. We want to store it so that next time someone asks for height of a student, we can easily return the value. But how can we store these heights?

Obviously we can use a database and store these values. But, let's say we don't want to do that for now. We want to use a data structure to store these values as part of our program. For the sake of simplicity, our problem is limited to storing heights of students. But you can certainly imagine scenarios where you have to store such `key-value` pairs and later on when someone gives you a key, you can efficiently return the corrresponding `value`.

The class diagram for HashMaps would look something like this.

```Python
class HashMap:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.num_entries = 0
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        pass
    
    def get(self, key):
        pass
    
    def size(self):
        return self.num_entries
```

___


**Arrays**
Can we use arrays to store key-value pairs?

We can certainly use one array to store the names of the students and use another array to store their corresponding heights at the corresponding indices.

What will be the time complexity in this scenario?

To obtain height of a student, say Potter, Harry, we will have to traverse the entire array and check if the value at a particular index matches Potter, Harry. Once we find the index in which this value is stored, we can use this index to obtain the height from the second array.

Thus, because of this traveral, complexity for get() operation becomes  ùëÇ(ùëõ) . Even if we maintain a sorted array, the operation will not take less than  ùëÇ(ùëôùëúùëî(ùëõ))  complexity.

What happens if a student leaves a class? We will have to delete the entry corresponding to the student from both the arrays.

This would require another traversal to find the index. And then we will have to shift our entire array to fill this gap. Again, the time complexity of operation becomes  ùëÇ(ùëõ) 

___

**Linked List**
Is it possible to use linked lists for this problem?

We can certainly modify our LinkedListNode to have two different value attributes - one for name of the student and the other for height.

But we again face the same problem. In the worst case, we will have to traverse the entire linked list to find the height of a particular student. Once again, the cost of operation becomes ùëÇ(ùëõ).

___

**Stacks and Queues**
Stacks and Queues are LIFO and FIFO data structures respectively. Can you think why they too do not make a good choice for storing key-value pairs?

Can we do better? Can you think of any data structure that allows for fast get() operation?

Let us circle back to arrays.

When we obtain the element present at a particular index using something like arr[3], the operation takes constant i.e. O(1) time.

For review - Does this constant time operation require further explanation?

If we think about array indices as keys and the element present at those indices as values, we can fairly conclude that at least for non-zero integer keys, we can use arrays.

However, like our current problem statement, we may not always have integer keys.

If only we had a function that could give us arrays indices for any key value that we gave it!

___

**Hash Functions**
Simply put, hash functions are these really incredible magic functions which can map data of any size to a fixed size data. This fixed sized data is often called hash code or hash digest.

Let's create our own hash function to store strings

```Python
def hash_function(string):
    pass
```
For a given string, say abcd, a very simple hash function can be sum of corresponding ASCII values.

Note: you can use ord(character) to determine ASCII value of a particular character e.g. ord('a') will return 97

```Python
def hash_function(string):
    hash_code = 0
    for character in string:
        hash_code += ord(character)
    return hash_code
```

```Python
hash_code_1 = hash_function("abcd")
print(hash_code_1)
```

___

Looks like our hash function is working fine. But is this really a good hash function?

For starters, it will return the same value for `abcd` and `bcda`. Do we want that? We can create 24 different permutations for the string abcd and each will have the same value. We cannot put 24 values to one index.

Obviously, this makes it clear that our hash function must return unique values for unique objects.

When two different inputs produce the same output, then we have something called a `collision`. An ideal hash function must be immune from producing collisions.

Let's think something else.

Can product help? We will again run in the same problem.

The honest answer is that we have differernt hash functions for different types of keys. The hash function for integers will be different from the hash function for strings, which again, will be different for some object of a class that you created.

However, let's try to continue with our problem and try to come up with a hash function for strings.

**Hash Function for Strings**
For a string, say abcde, a very effective function is treating this as number of prime number base  p. Let's elaborate this statement.

For a number, say 578, we can represent this number in base 10 number system as
5‚àó102+7‚àó101+8‚àó100

Similarly, we can treat abcde as
ùëé‚àóùëù4+ùëè‚àóùëù3+ùëê‚àóùëù2+ùëë‚àóùëù1+ùëí‚àóùëù0

Here, we replace each character with its corresponding ASCII value.

A lot of research goes into figuring out good hash functions and this hash function is one of the most popular functions used for strings. We use prime numbers because the provide a good distribution. The most common prime numbers used for this function are 31 and 37.

Thus, using this algorithm, we can get a corresponding integer value for each string key and store it in the array.

Note that the array used for this purpose is called a `bucket array`. It is not a special array. We simply choose to give a special name to arrays for this purpose. Each entry in this bucket array is called a `bucket` and the index in which we store a bucket is called `bucket index`.

Let's add these details to our class.

```Python
hash_map = HashMap()

bucket_index = hash_map.get_bucket_index("abcd")
print(bucket_index)
```
5204554

```Python
hash_map = HashMap()

bucket_index = hash_map.get_bucket_index("bcda")
print(bucket_index)
```
5054002

___

**Compression Function**
We now have a good hash function which will return unique values for unique objects. But let's look at the values. These are huge. We cannot create such large arrays. So we use another function - `compression function` to compress these values so as to create arrays of reasonable sizes.

A very simple, good, and effective compression function can be `mod len(array)`. The `modulo operator %` returns the remainder of one number when divided by other.

So, if we have an array of size 10, we can be sure that modulo of any number with 10 will be less than 10, allowing it to fit into our bucket array.

Because of how modulo operator works, instead of creating a new function, we can write the logic for compression function in our `get_hash_code()` function itself.

```Python
class HashMap:
    
    def __init__(self, initial_size = 10):
        self.bucket_array = [None for _ in range(initial_size)]
        self.p = 31
        self.num_entries = 0
        
    def put(self, key, value):
        pass
    
    def get(self, key):
        pass
        
    def get_bucket_index(self, key):
        bucket_index = self.get_hash_code(keu)
        return bucket_index
    
    def get_hash_code(self, key):
        key = str(key)
        num_buckets = len(self.bucket_array)
        current_coefficient = 1
        hash_code = 0
        for character in key:
            hash_code += ord(character) * current_coefficient
            hash_code = hash_code % num_buckets                       # compress hash_code
            current_coefficient *= self.p
            current_coefficient = current_coefficient % num_buckets   # compress coefficient

        return hash_code % num_buckets                                # one last compression before returning
    
    
    def size(self):
        return self.num_entries
```

**Collision Handling**

As discussed earlier, when two different inputs produce the same output, then we have a collision. Our implementation of `get_hash_code()` function is satisfactory. However, because we are using compression function, we are prone to collisions. 

Consider the following scenario. 

We have a bucket array of length 10 and we get two different hash codes for two different inputs, say 355, and 1095. Even though the hash codes are different in this case, the bucket index will be same because of the way we have implemented our compression function. Such scenarios where multiple entries want to go to the same bucket are very common. So, we introduce some logic to handle collisions.

There are two popular ways in which we handle collisions.

1. Closed Addressing or Separate chaining
2. Open Addressing

1. Closed addressing is a clever technique where we use the same bucket to store multiple objects. The bucket in this case will store a linked list of key-value pairs. Every bucket has it's own separate chain of linked list nodes.

2. In open addressing, we do the following:
    * If, after getting the bucket index,  the bucket is empty, we store the object in that particular bucket
    
    * If the bucket is not empty, we find an alternate bucket index by using another function which modifies the current hash code to give a new code
    

Separate chaining is a simple and effective technique to handle collisions and that is what we discuss here. 

Implement the `put` and `get` function using the idea of separate chaining. 

```Python
class LinkedListNode:
    
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class HashMap:
    
    def __init__(self, initial_size = 10):
        self.bucket_array = [None for _ in range(initial_size)]
        self.p = 31
        self.num_entries = 0
        
    def put(self, key, value):
        bucket_index = self.get_bucket_index(key)

        new_node = LinkedListNode(key, value)
        head = self.bucket_array[bucket_index]

        # check if key is already present in the map, and update it's value
        while head is not None:
            if head.key == key:
                head.value = value
                return
            head = head.next

        # key not found in the chain --> create a new entry and place it at the head of the chain
        head = self.bucket_array[bucket_index]
        new_node.next = head
        self.bucket_array[bucket_index] = new_node
        self.num_entries += 1

            if head.key == key:
                return head.value

print("size: {}".format(hash_map.size()))

**Time Complexity and Rehashing**
We used arrays to implement our hashmaps because arrays offer ùëÇ(1) time complexity for both put and get operations.

Note: in case of arrays put is simply arr[i] = 5 and get is height = arr[5]

1. Put Operation
In the put operation, we first figure out the bucket index. Calculating the hash code to figure out the bucket index takes some time.

After that, we go to the bucket index and in the worst case we traverse the linked list to find out if the key is already present or not. This also takes some time.

To analyze the time complexity for any algorithm as a function of the input size n, we first have to determine what our input is. In this case, we are putting and gettin key value pairs. So, these entries i.e. key-value pairs are our input. Therefore, our n is number of such key-value pair entries.

Note: time complexity is always determined in terms of input size and not the actual amount of work that is being done independent of input size. That "independent amount of work" will be constant for every input size so we disregard that.

In case of our hash function, the computation time for hash code depends on the size of each string. Compared to number of entries (which we always consider to be very high e.g. in the order of 105) the length of each string can be considered to be very small. Also, most of the strings will be around the same size when compared to this high number of entries. Hence, we can ignore the hash computation time in our analysis of time complexity.
Now, the entire time complexity essentialy depends on the linked list traversal. In the worst case, all entries would go to the same bucket index and our linked list at that index would be huge. Therefore, the time complexity in that scenario would be ùëÇ(ùëõ). However, hash functions are wisely chosen so that this does not happen.
On average, the distribution of entries is such that if we have n entries and b buckets, then each bucket does not have more than n/b key-value pair entries.

Therefore, because of our choice of hash functions, we can assume that the time complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõùëè). This number which determines the load on our bucket array n/b is known as load factor.

Generally, we try to keep our load factor around or less than 0.7. This essentially means that if we have a bucket array of size 10, then the number of key-value pair entries will not be more than 7.

What happens when we get more entries and the value of our load factor crosses 0.7?

In that scenario, we must increase the size of our bucket array. Also, we must recalculate the bucket index for each entry in the hashn map.

Note: the hash code for each key present in the bucket array would still be the same. However, because of the compression function, the bucket index will change.

Therefore, we need to rehash all the entries in our hash map. This is known as Rehashing.

**2. Get and Delete operation**
‚Äã
Can you figure out the time complexity for get and delete operation?
‚Äã
*Answer: the solution follows the same logic and the time complexity is O(1). Note that we do not reduce the size of bucket array in delete operation.*

**Rehashing Code**

Note: Theoretically, the worst case time complexity of `put` and `get`operations of a HashMap can be `O(n)`. However, our hashing functions are sophisticated enough that in real-life we easily avoid collisions and never hit `O(n)`. Rather, for the most part, we can safely assume that the time complexity of `put` and `get` operations will be `O(1)`.

Therefore, when you are asked to solve any practice problem involving HashMaps, assume the worst case time complexity for `put` and `get` operations to be `O(1)`.

### 9. String Keys

You just need to come up with some hash function that converts letters into numbers. Individual letters can be pretty easily converted into ASCII values and many languages already have that function built in to do that. We can combine the ASCII values with a formula to get a unique hash for each letter. 

There are some trade offs here. 

--> Do we want every word in it's own bucket?

--> Are you okay with collisions, but want a relatively simple hash function?

If you have 30 or less words, you can probably just use the ASCII value for first letter of the string as a hash value. 

The standard hash code function for string keys in Java there is a large hash table over having any collisions. 

The formula looks something like this:

`s[0] * 31^(n-1) + s[1] * 31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]`

For example say we are going to hash the word `Udacity` and we are starting with the first two letters of the string, `UD`.

We can plug these ASCII values into the equation to get our hash value that is unique to our string.

`U = 85`
`D = 68`

`(85 * 31^1) + 68 = 2703`

--> Why does this work?

Well by multiplying the ASCII value for each letter by a power of some number like 31, we can guarantee that every number representation or hash value will be unique to that string. 

ASCII values for common characters:

32 to 126

A hash function like that would be great for a dictionary where we need unique buckets for each string.
